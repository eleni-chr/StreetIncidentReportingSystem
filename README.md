# StreetIncidentReportingSystem
Incident Reporting System for Street Safety

Code written by Eleni Christoforidou, 2023.

See attached PPTX file for a presentation overview of the app/code.

This is the first draft of an application that allows users to report street safety incidents and helps local authorities identify problem areas.

Users can submit incident reports with descriptions and locations. Incident data is aggregated to create heatmaps and identify problem areas. Local authorities can use the data to prioritise street safety improvements.

Not all parts of the code have been fully implemented.
